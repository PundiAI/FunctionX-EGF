Sports athletes from NBA, WNBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, ICC, Olympics, etc. lead the fan engagement model in our metaverse through gaming, unrivaled experiences, NFTs, and crypto tokenomics.

## Project Description
![Lootmogul Demo - Build your own metaverse land](https://github.com/nilesh-sukalikar/image-storage/blob/main/new-metaverse-3.jpg?raw=true)

LootMogul is an influencer-led sports metaverse gaming platform powered by exclusive properties (Lands, Stadium, Arenas, etc.), NFTs, and token rewards for the fans and business community.

There are three key stakeholders in the Lootmogul community:

**Sports Athletes (Influencers)** engage with their fans in local stadiums, arenas, playgrounds, etc. through multiplayer blockchain sports games (basketball, football, soccer, baseball, pickleball, etc.) and In-Real-Life (IRL) rewards (Shoes, fitness wear, event ticket & passes, etc.)

**Fans** enjoy an immersive experience with influencers by playing games with sports athletes' avatars, forming dream teams (ex. Larry Bird playing against Shaq), and competing at a global level.

**Land Owners** earn revenue from ticket sales, game revenue, NFT revenue, and brand sponsorship.

LootMogul has a first mover advantage in this fast-growing $800B industry and has partnered with more than 180 professional athletes from the NBA, NFL, MLB, eSports, ICC, etc., and 1.5M+ high-school and college athletes.

LootMogul is expanding the web3 community by bringing web 2 gamers and sports fanatics to the metaverse with a play-to-earn model, real-world perks, experiences, and NFT collections.

Companies or gaming guilds can own or lease NFT stadiums, seats, banners, celebrity avatars, game power, wearables etc. for their community and scholars at a 25% to 75% discount with 4% APY during the pre-sale events and mega-launch parties such as the NBA all-star weekend, NFL Superbowl, World Championship etc.

Finally, LootMogul's seed round is funded by billion-dollar Web3 crypto companies and Web2 traditional equity venture funds - Harmony, PowerHouse Ventures, BCT, and u2poia, with grants from Polygon and Sandbox. Our token round of investments is going to be led by Woodstock, SL2 Capital, Animoca Brands and others.

We intend to create a staking derivatives on FunctionX Network. More implementations will increase capital efficiency in the FunctionX Network and enable SCRT staked to secure FunctionX Network to be used in other FunctionX Network applications such as DeFi, governance and games.

Our team has been closely following Ethereum DeFi and FunctionX Network in the last year, and are active in the chat channels. Needless to say, we are really excited to see this project evolve.

## Problem / Solution

### Problem : 
- Sports athletes do not have the opportunity to build community, engagement, monetize and be part of the metaverse. They are unable to capitalize on their global fan engagement etc.

### Solution 
- Play with your favourite sports influencers in a metaverse
- Influencer led fan engagement in a sports and entertainment centric metaverse through multi-player blockchain-games, NFTs, crypto and In Real Life (IRL) rewards

## Our Vision (What we are building)
#### A MULTIVERSE FOR SPORTS INFLUENCERS AND FANS TO ENGAGE POWERED BY GAMING GUILDS AND BRANDS
- We build a sports fan engagement model through our competitive multi-player blockchain games, NFTs, and real-world celebrity experiences.
- We provide simplified tools for celebrities, fans, game developers & metaverse platforms to personalize & integrate with our sports community
- We empower gaming guilds, brands, and the community to own, lease and earn lifetime royalties through NFT stadiums, seats, avatars, wearables, etc.

## Why Us?
#### We are expanding the Web3 community by bringing Web2 sports fanatics & gamers into the metaverse.
- Our star athletes use a unique academy approach to coach/engage with their fans through our metaverse games, leadership camps with In-Real Life (IRL) access & rewards. Our first multi-player trivia game is already live and many more will come over the next several months.
- Companies or Gaming guilds can own or lease NFT stadiums, seats, banners, celebrity avatars, game power, wearables, etc. for their community and scholars at a 25% to 75% discount with 4% APY during the members-only (Lootmogul Citizen) pre-sale events and mega launch parties such as NBA all-star weekend, NFL Superbowl, World Championship, etc.
- First mover advantage of bringing professional athletes, sports influencers, and fans to a metaverse gaming platform with real-world exclusive celebrities' experiences and their own real estate (sports metaverse* lands, e.g. stadium, playgrounds, studios, experience labs, etc.)
